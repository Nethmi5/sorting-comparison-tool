# sorting-comparison-tool
📘 A console-based Python tool that compares Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Users can input or generate data, view sorted results, and compare algorithm performance by execution time and operation count through an interactive, menu-driven interface.

🎯 Objectives

Understand and visualize how different sorting algorithms behave.

Measure the execution time and operation count for each algorithm.

Compare sorting efficiency for small and large datasets.

Practice modular programming, teamwork, and GitHub collaboration.


⚙️ Features

✅ Menu-driven console interface — simple and easy to use
✅ Manual or automatic data input
✅ Implements three algorithms:

Bubble Sort (22UG3-0504)

Merge Sort (22UG3-0504)

Quick Sort (22UG3-0504)
✅ Performance tracking:

Execution time (seconds)

Step/operation count
✅ Comparison table to summarize all results
✅ Proper input validation and error handling

🧠 System Flow
